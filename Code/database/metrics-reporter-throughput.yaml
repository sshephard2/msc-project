# This is an example file for configuring which metrics should go
# where.  The sample sends everything to a flat file for humans to
# poke at.  metrics-ganglia or metrics-graphite are more likely to
# operationally useful.

# Some metrics are global for a node (KeyCache capacity) while others
# are broken down by column family or even IP.  The sample list
# includes all of the global metrics via a while list.  To include
# metrics for the system column family for example add
# "^org.apache.cassandra.metrics.ColumnFamily.system.+".
