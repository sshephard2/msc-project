\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

...

An interesting area of future work might be in using the modelling techniques in adaptive algorithms.  A model might be used as a policy for elastic scaling, and compared with the performance of other right-sizing strategies; control theory, machine learning and other model based techniques including statistical.
