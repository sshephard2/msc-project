\begin{abstract}
On-line Transaction Processing (OLTP) applications must frequently deal with the issue of skewed demand for some resources.  This demand may overwhelm the whole system, affecting the owner's reputation and revenue.  This paper presents system architectures for a ticketing use case using a selection of distributed computing technologies of the Cloud.  It proposes models of these architectures and uses them to predict throughput in skewed demand scenarios.  The experimental results of the models are then tested against simple built systems.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

There are many high-profile examples of whole IT systems brought down by customer demand for part of their services.  Customers were prevented from using any part of the London 2012 Olympic ticketing website on launch day to avoid demand overloading the system \cite{RN1067}.  HBO Go was brought down by demand for the finale of ``True Detective'' \cite{RN1066}.  Apple's iTunes Store suffered outage on the launch day of the iPhone 7 (new iPhone registration is carried out via an iTunes function) \cite{RN1068}.
\begin{shaded}
Some more examples, preferably from peer-reviewed papers? (p2p file sharing, multi-tenanting?)
\end{shaded}
It is claimed that it is possible to design and build more resilient systems through effective use of Cloud technologies where higher than normal demand for one function or type of resource would not block access to the others.  Skewed demand may be isolated so that it only affects parts of a system, or shared equally between different components. (The system may also adapt to demand by elastic scaling of resources, but this will not be considered as part of this paper).

It is proposed that a selection of technologies may be modelled as simple components, that may be composed into more complex system models that make end to end predictions.  When combining a middleware solution with a distributed database, where is the system bottleneck?  If there are levels of demand that cannot be met on a limited budget, and that therefore some components will no longer meet the required throughput, what is the impact on the remainder of the system?

The models will then be tested against actual systems, built using Java and the Java Spring framework \cite{RN1076}, Cassandra \cite{RN1050}\cite{RN1075} databases, and where appropriate Microsoft Azure Storage Queues \cite{RN1072}.  These systems will be instrumented with Coda Hale Metrics \cite{RN1079} and measured under different scenarios of skewed demand, using Apache JMeter test plans \cite{RN1074}.

\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

Consider a general OLTP application using a distributed architecture, as shown in Figure \ref{figure:oltpapplication}.  Users access the application with a web-based front end.  Resources are stored in one or more databases.  In between the web servers and database are worker applications that service user requests, connected to the web servers by some middleware.  There are strategies for coping with skewed demand at each of the layers of this architecture.

\paragraph{Adapting.} A system using {\itshape elastic scaling} may adapt to increased demand. Rapid elasticity is an essential characteristic of Cloud Computing by the NIST definition \cite{RN56}.  Computing resources, for example web servers or worker applications, can be elastically and often automatically scaled to meet current demand.  This gives the appearance of resources that are limited only by the system owner's budget.

\paragraph{Sharing.} High demand may be shared between resources.  HTTP load balancing improves the scalability of a web-based application by distributing the demand across multiple web servers \cite{RN73}.  Shared middleware such as a point-to-point queue, provides a competing consumer pattern to balance load from several producers, e.g. web servers, between multiple consumers e.g. worker applications.

\paragraph{Isolating.} If it is not possible to satisfy the skewed demand within a given budget, then it may be appropriate to isolate that demand from the rest of the system.  Horizontal partitioning of a distributed database can place high demand resources on different data nodes.  Microservices architecture offers a pattern for partitioning the data resources, the worker applications and the web servers using them into entirely separate smaller end to end services.

\subsection{Use Case}

The concrete use case for constructing models and building systems is a ticketing application.  Following the Olympic example given in the Introduction, tickets will be for a multi-sport event.  Some sports are more popular than others and it will be assumed that there will be predictable skewed demand for {\itshape athletics} tickets.  Use cases where the skewed demand is unknown - where the areas of highest demand are only discovered once the application goes online, requiring some adaptive approach - are out of scope.

The application has three possible operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Search (for available tickets)
\item Book (allocate a ticket to a customer)
\item Return (customer releases a ticket allocation)
\end{enumerate}

Such a ticketing application may be generalised to any system for allocating and releasing other resources with variable demand.

This paper considers the problem of higher than average demand for a particular type of ticket, and to what extent the system will allow users to search for other ticket types if some component is overloaded by the skewed demand for the most popular tickets.  It does not consider issues of fair allocation of scarce resources.
