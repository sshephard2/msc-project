\begin{abstract}
On-line Transaction Processing (OLTP) applications must frequently deal with the issue of skewed demand for some resources.  This demand may overwhelm the whole system, affecting the owner's reputation and revenue.  In this article we present a ticketing use case and argue that at each layer of the architecture, the distributed computing technologies of the Cloud may maintain throughput to the lower demand resources, maximising the available functionality of the system.

\section{Introduction}

There are many high-profile examples of whole IT systems brought down by customer demand for part of their services.  Customers were prevented from using any part of the London 2012 Olympic ticketing website on launch day to avoid demand overloading the system \cite{RN1067}.  HBO Go was brought down by demand for the finale of ``True Detective'' \cite{RN1066}.  Apple's iTunes Store suffered outage on the launch day of the iPhone 7 (new iPhone registration is carried out via an iTunes function) \cite{RN1068}.

It is possible to design and build more resilient systems through effective use of Cloud technologies where higher than normal demand for one function or type of resource would not block access to the others.  Skewed demand may be isolated so that it only affects parts of a system, or shared equally between different components. (The system may also adapt to demand by elastic scaling of resources, but this will not be considered as part of this paper).

We will briefly discuss Middleware, Microservices and Distributed Databases and show how they provide strategies for managing demand.  In a complex system we need to examine the end to end impacts.  Does removing a bottleneck at the Web or Worker Application layer shift the stress to the middleware, or the database?  If we accept that some levels of demand cannot be met on a limited budget, and that some components will no longer meet the required throughput, how do we determine the impact on the remainder of the system?  To examine these questions we will build models of an example system using different architectures; to test the models we will build out these systems and measure how demand impacts the throughput.

\section{Background}

We will consider an example system based on the Olympic ticketing use case above.  Such a ticketing application may be generalised to any system for allocating and releasing other resources with variable demand.

Tickets will be for a multi-sport event, and each will consist of a ticket type (the sport), date, row, and seat number.  The system will support three operations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Search (for available tickets)
\item Book (allocate a ticket to a customer)
\item Return (customer releases a ticket allocation)
\end{enumerate}

If it is not possible to search for or book tickets of one type because some component is overloaded due to demand, then the system should allow booking of other ticket types.  It must also always be possible to return tickets of any type.

In this paper, we are considering the problem of high demand for types of ticket.  This is not about the number of tickets available and we will not consider issues of fair allocation of scarce resources.  The demand may be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item predictable - we know which functions or ticket types are going to have the highest demand; or
\item unknown - we discover the areas of highest demand once the application goes online.
\end{enumerate}
